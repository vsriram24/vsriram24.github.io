    "text": "I currently work as a clinical data scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center Data Science Lab (DaSL) in Seattle, WA. My role focuses on the development and productization of statistical models and machine learning systems for electronic phenotyping and cohort identification across the institution. I also serve as a guest lecturer in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics at the University of Pennsylvania and a collaborator with the Health Futures Group at Microsoft Research.\nPrior to my position at Fred Hutch, I completed my Ph.D. and postdoctoral training in Biomedical Informatics and Computational Genomics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. There, I worked with Dr. Dokyoon Kim’s Integrative ’Omics and Biomedical Informatics Lab, developing machine learning and graph-based methods to identify genetic contributors to disease comorbidities from large-scale multimodal biomedical data (You can listen to a recording of my public thesis defense here!)\nIn addition to my doctoral degree, I hold a M.A. in Statistics and Data Science from the Wharton School of Business, as well as a B.Sc. with honors in Statistics, a B.Sc. in Computer Science, and a minor in Computational Biology from Duke University."
