    "text": "I currently work as a clinical data scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center Data Science Lab (DaSL) in Seattle, WA. My role focuses on the development and productization of statistical models and machine learning systems for electronic phenotyping and cohort identification across the institution. I also serve as a guest lecturer in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics at the University of Pennsylvania and a collaborator with the Health Futures Group at Microsoft Research.\nPrior to my position at Fred Hutch, I completed my Ph.D. and postdoctoral training in Biomedical Informatics and Computational Genomics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. There, I worked with Dr. Dokyoon Kim’s Integrative ’Omics and Biomedical Informatics Lab, developing machine learning and graph-based methods to identify genetic contributors to disease comorbidities from large-scale multimodal biomedical data (You can listen to a recording of my public thesis defense here!)\nIn addition to my doctoral degree, I hold a M.A. in Statistics and Data Science from the Wharton School of Business, as well as a B.Sc. with honors in Statistics, a B.Sc. in Computer Science, and a minor in Computational Biology from Duke University."

    "text": "Hello world, and welcome to my official blog! I’ve had numerous thoughts swirling around in my head over the past several years, but have had trouble formally committing to bringing them out into the world… however, encouragement from colleagues and recent reading (i.e. Dorie Clark’s The Long Game) have convinced me to finally bring my virtual pen to paper. In particular, I found myself tremendously inspired by the Fred Hutch DaSL Culture and Work Style document and the mantra of “ship as soon as you can.” The following graphic does a great job at reminding us how to avoid the pit of perfectionism!\n\nMy hopes for this blog are to (a) build a community, (b) share my knowledge, and (c) learn alongside my readers. I aim to write weekly (if not more frequent) posts on a variety of subjects, including:\n\nmy personal story\nadvice to others in my field\ntechnical tutorials\nsubject matter overviews, and\nmiscellaneous detours\n\nI have no expectations that my content will be perfect, but then again, learning from mistakes is one of the best parts of life :)\nGiven my background and expertise, my general focus will be on the world of biomedical data science and health technology, but the sky is the limit for the topics we may cover!\nThanks for tuning in - I’m delighted to have you along for the ride…"
