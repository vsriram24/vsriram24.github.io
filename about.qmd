I’m a Senior Health AI Scientist working at the intersection of generative AI, agentic systems, and multimodal biomedical data, with a focus on building reliable, interpretable, and production-grade AI systems that deliver real-world impact in healthcare. Across roles, my work bridges biology, clinical data, and enterprise AI systems, from multiomic and molecular data to clinical text, imaging, and real-world healthcare data.

I currently work with the Enterprise AI organization at [Humana](https://www.humana.com), where I build responsible, production-grade generative AI and agentic systems embedded in large-scale healthcare workflows. My work focuses on multimodal and transformer-based models, rigorous evaluation and governance, and close collaboration with engineering and clinical teams to deliver reliable, real-world impact.

Previously, I served as a Machine Learning Scientist in the [Chief Data Office](https://ocdo.fredhutch.org) at the [Fred Hutch Cancer Center](#0) in Seattle, WA, where I led the development and deployment of institution-wide clinical NLP and machine learning systems for automated, longitudinal phenotyping and cohort identification from large-scale EHR data. I partnered closely with clinicians, translational researchers, product managers, and engineers to validate models, benchmark performance, and assess downstream impact on research and clinical workflows. I also contributed to enterprise clinical data harmonization efforts and developed human-centered, open-source tools and documentation to support scalable analytics and reproducible research across the institution.

Before industry, I completed my PhD and postdoctoral training in [Biomedical Informatics and Computational Genomics](https://www.med.upenn.edu/gcb/) at the University of Pennsylvania [Perelman School of Medicine](#0), where I worked with Dr. [Dokyoon Kim](#0)’s [Integrative ’Omics and Biomedical Informatics Lab](#0). My dissertation focused on the development of graph-based machine learning methods to identify genetic contributors to disease comorbidities from large-scale, multimodal biomedical data (You can listen to a recording of my public thesis defense [here](#0)!) I also hold a Master’s degree in Statistics and Data Science from the [Wharton School of Business](#0), as well as undergraduate degrees in Statistics and Computer Science and a minor in Computational Biology from [Duke University](#0).

In addition to my industry work, I serve as a Guest Lecturer in the [Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics](#0) at the [University of Pennsylvania](#0), and I previously collaborated with the [Health Futures Group](#0) at [Microsoft Research](#0) on applied research at the intersection of biomedical discovery and emerging AI technologies.

I’m experienced with machine learning, statistical modeling, and data pipelines in Python, SQL, R, Docker, and AWS, and I enjoy working at the boundary of research, engineering, and real-world deployment. My broader interests include responsible AI, generative models, translational informatics, personalized medicine, and human-centered system design. In my free time, I love exploring the PNW wilderness with my wife, taking our pup out for long walks around the neighborhood, and trying out new recipes in the kitchen.
