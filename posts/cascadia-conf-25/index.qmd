# Cascadia R Conf 2025 Recap: R as a Swiss Army Knife—and Then Some

Welcome back to another week of *\[VS\]Codes*! A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to attend [Cascadia R Conference 2025](https://cascadiarconf.com), a local R conference for the data science community of the Pacific Northwest. It was a great experience getting to see so many different applications of data science across a variety of industries, and I very much enjoyed the experience of connecting with other data scientists from the surrounding PNW area. This blog post will summarize content from some of the talks that I attended that day as well as my personal overall takeaways from the conference.

From automating workflows and building public dashboards to integrating AI into your R scripts, the talks showcased how R continues to evolve—not just as a language, but as an ecosystem.

Here are some of my highlights from the conference:

## Keynote: 25 Things You Didn’t Know You Could Do With R

-   David Keyes

R isn't just a statistical tool - it's a Swiss Army knife for data.

David took us on a whirlwind tour of R's lesser-known superpowers:

-   Access data automagically: Use googlesheets4, qualtRics, and tidycensus to grab live data. Tap into APIs with httr2 or scrape the web with rvest.

-   Level up your data viz: Create custom ggplot themes and use theme_set() and update_geom_defaults() for consistency across plots.

-   Make beautiful maps: Go spatial with sf, and interactive with mapgl.

-   Publish like a pro: Use Quarto + Netlify to make websites, and even generate PDFs with Typst.

-   Automate the boring stuff: Email reports with blastula, gmailr, or GitHub Actions.

-   AI in R workflows: Add instructions to tailor AI tools like GitHub Copilot. Explore gander for environment introspection and ellmer or mall for LLM-powered data analysis.

## Building Smarter R Workflows

### Leveraging LLMs in R

-   Yan Liu

Yan explored how large language models (LLMs) can transform R workflows—especially when dealing with unstructured, qualitative data. Using the {ellmer} package, you can:

-   Call LLMs like GPT-4o or LLaMA directly from your R environment.

-   Generate text from plots or images.

-   Classify free-text survey responses.

-   Translate content at scale.

He emphasized prompt engineering, validation, and ethical concerns like data privacy and model bias.

### {lessR}: Comprehensive Analysis with Minimal Code

-   David Gerbing

David showed how the {lessR} package enables complete statistical analysis with minimal input:

-   One Read() function to import anything.

-   One Write() function to export everything.

-   Built-in visualizations like BarChart() and Plot() that "just work" with smart defaults.

The goal? Reduce friction for teaching, learning, and doing statistics.

### Creating a Better Universe with {dverse}

-   Mauro Lepore

R developers working across many packages will love {dverse}, a tool for documenting a universe of related packages:

-   document_universe(packages, template) auto-generates cohesive docs.

-   Integrates global search across multiple packages (e.g., pactaverse).

## Lightning Talks: Automation Edition

-   Megan Holtorf showed how to send scheduled updates via email using GitHub Actions, Quarto, and {blastula}.

-   Lindsay Dickey walked through parameterized reporting in RMarkdown for dynamic report generation.

-   Frank Aragona tackled language translation in R using {lightparser} to parse and update .qmd files programmatically.

## Development in R

### 10 Years of RStudio and What’s Next

-   Jonathan McPherson

Jonathan reflected on RStudio’s growth and previewed Positron, a next-gen IDE aiming for:

Multi-language support Multiple sessions Best-in-class features Positron aims to unify the toolchain for all data scientists, while RStudio continues to be the gold standard for R-centric workflows. And yes, AI integration is coming—with models that understand your code, your data, and your computational context.

### Supercharge Your Work with GitHub Actions

-   Ben Matheson

GitHub Actions isn't just for package checks anymore:

Schedule CRON jobs Automate website builds Email reports Keep analyses up-to-date Ben walked us through the anatomy of an action: workflows, jobs, steps—all powered by YAML.

### From Frustration to Function

-   Dror Berel

Dror shared how tools like LLMs helped him overcome adoption barriers for new R packages. His advice?

Keep things simple. Reduce cognitive load. Use storytelling to make your outputs approachable.

## R in Action

### Metadata-Driven Data Science

-   Peter Geissert

Peter described the trap of "Potemkin Village Data Science"—flashy outputs hiding fragile workflows. His solution: build around metadata to enable reuse, reduce maintenance, and ensure consistency across systems.

### Introducing R to Your Friends

-   Hanna Winter

Her message: no task is too small for R. Whether it's automating calculations or switching from expensive software to open-source tools, R can handle it.

### R for Public Transit Analysis

-   Evan Landman

Transit data is complex and inherently spatial. Evan walked through a workflow combining:

tidycensus, ipumsr, and custom mobility datasets Spatial analysis in R Reusable tools packaged from one-off analyses

## Lightning Talks

### BLS API with R

-   Samer Hijjazi

Use the httr package to pull time series data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and build labor market analyses.

## R in Public Health

### Public Health Dashboards

-   Ariane Erickson

Great dashboards need to be accessible and performant. She emphasized:

Accessibility: font size, contrast, navigation Feedback: user testing, feedback forms Tech tips: shinyally and bslib

### From REDCap to Reporting

-   Arilene Novak & Andie Hendrick

The duo shared how they used Quarto and REDCap APIs to automate weekly reports and expand to more surveillance metrics.

### Evaluating Access to Healthcare

-   Alec Kretchun

Modern spatial workflows in public health involve:

PostGIS-enabled Postgres databases REST APIs via plumber R Shiny dashboards for dissemination

## Final Thoughts

Cascadia R Conf reminded me why I love this language and this community. The innovation is impressive—but even more important is the collaboration. Whether you’re building AI-powered apps or just figuring out how to make your reports prettier, there’s someone in the R community who’s done it, written a package for it, and is excited to help you learn.

R isn’t just a programming language—it’s a movement.

This concludes my summary of my experience at Cascadia R Conference 2024! I'd like to give a huge thank you to the [organizers](https://cascadiarconf.com/about/) of this conference for all of their hard work and for bringing the PNW data science community together in such a wonderful event. The next conference I will be attending will be [posit::conf(2024)](https://posit.co/conference/), and I look forward to summarizing my experiences there in another blog post. Until next week, \[VS\]Coders!
