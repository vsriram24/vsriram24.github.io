Welcome back to another edition of *\[VS\]Codes*! In this week's post, I'll be summarizing a list of the top blogs / newsletters to which I subscribe, including content that covers biotech and health AI, data science and software, and a few miscellaneous topics at the end. Note that all of these newsletters allow for free base subscriptions (with options for paid tiered subscriptions to support the creators if desired). Without further ado, let's get started!

***Medical Informatics, Biotechnology, and Health AI***

1.  "[AMIA Informatics SmartBrief](https://newsletter.smartbrief.com/rest/sign-up/FCE90269-079A-4211-B3E0-85FCEDCFBE17?pageName=TELLMEMORE)" by the [American Medical Informatics Association](https://amia.org)

    "AMIA Informatics SmartBrief" offers a daily snapshot of biomedical informatics with news from a variety of health informatics sources. In particular, I appreciate that subscribers can select the topic categories that most interest them: I am personally subscribed to "Top News," "Clinical Informatics and Analytics," "Health Data Science and Artificial Intelligence," "Population Health, " and "AMIA News".

2.  "[Decoding Bio](https://decodingbio.substack.com)" by [Amee Kapadia](https://x.com/ameekapadia), [Pablo Lubroth](https://x.com/pablolubroth), [Patrick Malone](https://x.com/patricksmalone), [Morgan Cheatham](https://x.com/morgancheatham), [Ketan Yerneni](https://x.com/KetanYerneni), and [Zahra Khwaja](https://x.com/ZahraKhwaja)

    "Decoding Bio" breaks down advancements at the intersection of computation and the life sciences. The authors focus on translating technical developments and trends in the biotech and "tech-bio" spaces into an easy-to-read format. The goal of the newsletter and the larger writing collective is to start conversation around changes in the biotech industry, including the rapid advancement of health AI.

3.  "[Doctor Penguin](https://doctorpenguin.substack.com)" by [Emma Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=89ANml4AAAAJ&hl=en), [Shreya Johri,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreya-johri/) [Pranav Rajpurkar](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/people/pranav-rajpurkar), and [Eric Topol](https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/topol/)

    The aim of "Doctor Penguin" is to help researchers keep up with the latest research updates in the field of AI and healthcare. Each week includes brief summaries of some of the latest top papers, as well as links to the original publications for subscribers to read.

4.  "[The Century of Biology](https://centuryofbio.com)" by [Elliot Hershberg](https://elliothershberg.com)

    Elliot is a current PhD student in the Department of Genetics at Stanford, as well as a biotechnology investor. His blog, "The Century of Biology," summarizes the latest progress in the field of biotechnology and offers three main topics of content: Data/Research, Companies/Strategy/Analysis, and Philosophy. Elliot's long term ambition is "to develop a philosophy outlining why it is a moral and aesthetic imperative to pursue biotechnology." Elliot is currently taking a break from writing his blog to defend his PhD, but there is a trove of content freely available that provides insightful examinations of biotech developments. I very much look forward to his return to writing later this year!

***Data Science and Software***

1.  "[Software Design: Tidy First?](https://tidyfirst.substack.com)" by [Kent Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck)

    Kent Beck's self-proclaimed mission is "to help geeks feel safe in the world." His blog achieves this goal by covering a variety of topics in programming and software development that encourage a perspective shift in the way that we approach work in the field of tech and beyond.

His blog of the same name tackles a variety of topics with non-intuitive answers from a statistical lens, proving with the power of computational statistics that everything is not as it seems!

This concludes my blog post for today! Now a note for my subscribers... with fall rolling around and work / life picking up, it's becoming more challenging to keep up with my weekly schedule of creating new content for the blog! So, I'll be taking a hiatus for the next month to turn my attention to some immediate deliverables, while also developing new content in the background. When I start posting again toward the end of October, I will likely switch to a bi-weekly release schedule to make this whole project more sustainable with respect to my personal schedule! Until we meet again\~
