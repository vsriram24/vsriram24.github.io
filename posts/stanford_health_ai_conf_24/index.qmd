### 1. Innovating at the Speed of Trust

-   Daniel Yang, MD - VP of AI and Emerging Technologies, Kaiser Permanente

The opening keynote of the conference presented by Dr. Daniel Yang centered on the importance of trust in driving innovation in the field of health AI. Indeed, introducing AI to the clinic requires full involvement from the clinician. Clinicians need to understand how the AI systems being implemented work so that they can decide when such systems can be trusted and when they might lead us astray. *Without trust, even the most advanced AI systems will be unable fulfill their full potential.*

**The need for AI in healthcare today**\
Today, there is an ever-growing mismatch between healthcare supply and demand. We face an aging population, as well as a new patient focus on convenience and a desire for hybrid approaches to healthcare. At the same time, the healthcare workforce is being stretched thin due to a shortage of workers and a bottleneck in the training time needed to produce new clinical experts. The consequences of this mismatch include rising healthcare costs, physician burnout, and limited access to treatment. AI has the potential to accelerate our ability to provide more healthcare to more people in need.

**Building a Framework for Trust**\
The speed of progress in health AI will ultimately depend on the speed of trust. Any missteps, such as patient harm or tools that fall short of expectations, will slow innovation considerably. A lot of time has been spent in developing a technology stack for AI to enhance its performance - key components of this "AI Tech Stack" include AI applications, cloud platforms, foundation models, and computing hardware. At the same time, the acceleration of AI and the reduction of the trust gap requires us to consider another missing stack - the "Human Stack," made up of people, priorities, processes, and policies.

-   *People*: 60% of Americans are uneasy about their providers using AI. Building trust will require rigorous trials, clinical evidence, and robust safety protocols.

-   *Priorities*: Focusing on "lighthouse use cases" help demonstrate AI’s value while targeting the areas of greatest impact.

-   *Processes*: Seamless integration of models into existing practiced workflows is vital.

-   *Policies*: Equitable adoption will require financial and policy frameworks to prevent an “AI divide” between well-resourced and underserved healthcare systems.

**Financial Incentives for Responsible AI**\
A critical question raised during the discussion was how to incentivize responsible AI. Currently, the burden of risk and implementation often falls on healthcare delivery systems themselves, posing challenges for smaller organizations with fewer resources. Policymakers could draw lessons from the 2009 HITECH Act, which spurred electronic health record (EHR) adoption by ensuring minimum standards and equitable access.

Dr. Yang's talk concluded that the key to unlocking AI’s transformative potential lies not only in advancing technology but in earning the trust of both patients and providers through safety, evidence, and equitable frameworks.

### 3. Evaluating and Deploying AI Tools: [The FURM Model](https://shahlab.stanford.edu/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=furm_paper_-_main_appendix_submitted_to_arxiv.pdf)

-   Dev Dash, MD, MPH - Clinical Assistant Professor, Stanford University

-   Lance Downing, MD - Clinical Assistant Professor, Stanford University

-   Sneha Jain, MD MBA - Clinical Assistant Professor, Stanford University

-   Timothy Keyes, PhD - Data Scientist, Stanford Health Care

Deploying AI tools in healthcare involves more than just developing high-performing models - it requires a comprehensive framework to assess their fairness, usefulness, reliability, and alignment with real-world constraints. Stanford’s FURM (Fairness, Usefulness, Reliability, and Monitoring) model provides a structured approach to evaluating and integrating AI tools into clinical workflows responsibly.

**The FURM Assessment Framework**

1.  **Stage 1: Pre-Deployment (What and Why)**

    -   Define the problem and assess the need for an AI solution.

    -   Simulate workflow integration to estimate usefulness and financial impact.

    -   Consider ethical implications and potential risks before proceeding.

2.  **Stage 2: Deployment (How)**

    -   Develop, test, and integrate the model into existing infrastructure and organizational workflows.

    -   Ensure alignment with operational policies and stakeholder capacities.

3.  **Stage 3: Post-Deployment (Impact)**

    -   Conduct prospective evaluations and ongoing monitoring to assess outcomes and address emerging issues.

**Key Considerations for Deploying AI in Healthcare**

-   **Identifying the "Job to Be Done" (JTBD)**\
    AI tools must address specific operational or clinical needs. Stakeholders adopt tools not for their novelty but to achieve tangible progress. Defining these JTBD upfront ensures that AI solutions align with practical goals.

-   **AI-Guided Workflows**\
    AI models operate within complex systems constrained by policies, capacities, and real-world dynamics. For example:

    -   AI for detecting undiagnosed Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) was constrained by reimbursement policies, leading to targeted testing only for symptomatic patients.

    -   LLMs for nursing end-of-shift reports revealed cultural and operational challenges, such as balancing template flexibility with nurse preferences.

-   **Analyzing Usefulness**

    -   Stanford’s [APLUS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046423000400?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=8f1908fbde7f756d) Python library evaluates AI models within realistic, capacity-constrained workflows.

    -   Correct and incorrect decisions are weighed according to their differing impacts on patients and healthcare systems.

-   **Cost and Operational Implications**

    -   Deployment decisions must consider the cost of building and sustaining AI workflows, as well as downstream financial and clinical impacts.

    -   Case studies highlighted how savings in time don’t always translate to financial benefits or improved care outcomes.

**Addressing Ethical Issues in Healthcare AI**

-   **Stakeholder Alignment**

    -   Ethical concerns arise from misaligned values among clinicians, developers, and patients. Organizations must mediate these differences through intake interviews, stakeholder analysis, and actionable reports. For instance, skepticism about LLMs improving documentation efficiency underscores the need for transparent communication and measurable results.

-   **Broader Ethical Vision**

    -   Ethical recommendations must translate into concrete actions to mitigate risks. Stanford is developing a "playbook" to guide other healthcare systems in addressing ethical concerns effectively.

**Realizing Value Beyond Models**\
Successful AI deployment is not just about the AI model but also the policies, workflows, and actions that surround it. By combining rigorous evaluations with thoughtful integration, the FURM framework ensures AI tools are not only effective but also equitable, ethical, and aligned with healthcare priorities.

    -   **Multimodality**: The healthcare data landscape spans diverse modalities, complicating integration and analysis.

    -   **Data Availability**: Time stamps in electronic health records (EHRs) often fail to reflect real-world conditions, reducing data reliability.

2.  **Workflow Design and Transferability**

    -   AI performance depends on the workflows and data structures underlying it, which may not transfer effectively between institutions.

    -   The ability to modify workflows and data structures introduces variability that impacts both model and operational performance.

3.  **Lifecycle Management**

    -   Managing data drift in externally created models is crucial to ensuring consistent performance.

    -   Deciding when and how to retrain or deprecate models requires timely and sufficient data collection, which is often challenging.

**Social Dynamics in Data Generation**\
Healthcare data is generated within a socially patterned and non-neutral space, reflecting biases and inequities. While AI has the potential to disrupt the status quo, its design and deployment must be deliberate to avoid perpetuating existing disparities.

**Standards and Frameworks**\

Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a transformative opportunity for healthcare, leveraging vast amounts of data to generate predictions, insights, and text-based interactions. However, their effective application in clinical settings requires balancing innovation with responsible deployment.

**Understanding LLMs**\
LLMs are trained by masking portions of input data (e.g., text) and using a Transformer model to predict the missing elements. The result is a numeric embedding - a representation of the input data that can be used for downstream tasks, including:

-   **Classifier Features**: Supporting machine learning models for prediction.

-   **Text Output**: Facilitating human-AI interaction.

LLMs are a subset of *foundation models*, which generalize across symbol vocabularies (e.g., sounds, pixels, or ICD codes). For example:

-   Predicting the likelihood of certain ICD codes over a timeline rather than generating the next word in text.

**Two Key Approaches in Healthcare AI**

1.  **Clinical Language Models (CLaMs)**

    -   Focus on textual outputs and generative tasks.

    -   Example: Summarizing clinical notes or generating predictions from text representations.

2.  **Foundation Models for Electronic Medical Records (FEMRs)**

    -   Focus on patient timelines and numerical embeddings for prediction tasks.

    -   Example: Predicting patient outcomes by analyzing sequences of events in their medical history.

**Shared EHR Structures Enable Transferability**\
EHRs exhibit consistent patterns that allow models to transfer learned embeddings to new tasks. This shared structure is a key advantage of foundation models in healthcare.

**Challenges and Priorities**\
While foundation models and LLMs hold great promise, the healthcare community faces challenges in scaling their deployment:

-   **Verification of Benefits**: There are too many models being developed and not enough focus on ensuring their utility in real-world settings.

    -   It’s crucial to differentiate between AI effectiveness (its performance) and AI utility (its practical use in real-world settings).

These discussions highlight the complexities of scaling and deploying AI in healthcare, emphasizing the need for thoughtful integration, continuous monitoring, and a focus on trustworthiness and usability in clinical settings.

### 11. Conclusions

This concludes my summary of the Stanford Health + AI Conference 2024!

My biggest takeaways from the conference were the following:

-   Remember the significance of relationship-building and trust during AI deployment. The "human stack" is much more important than the AI tech stack.

-   Keep the interests of the ultimate stakeholder (the patient) at the heart of any decision in infrastructure change.

-   AI model development is great, but it is just the start - successful deployment of AI into a healthcare system requires consideration of the surrounding processes, workflows, and ecosystems into which it will be placed.

With that, I'd like to give a huge thank you to Stanford AIMI and the organizers of this conference for all of their hard work as well as to all of the speakers and panelists for contributing their time and knowledge to such outstanding discussions. I left this conference feeling extremely inspired about my own work with the Fred Hutch Chief Data Office, and I am excited to bring my insights from these talks into my upcoming work as we productionize robust AI workflows for clinical research and care at our own institution. Until next time, \[VS\]Coders!
