In this week's and next week's posts, I will be providing an overview of the research I conducted during the course of my PhD at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. For a more detailed summary of my public thesis defense, you can listen here. You can read my entire dissertation here.

Coming from a primarily computational background, I was always aware of how complicated biology was. We have different organizational systems (e.g. human body, organ systems, organs, tissues, cells, intracellular systems, genes, etc.) Lots of ways for us to think aobut biology. Lots of ways that biology can be affected and maniuplated.

We need a unified language to understand this complexity. A common metric to think about the language of human biology is with human genetics. Geneitcs is the study of heritable traits (aka phenotypes). Genetic variation is a significant component of the diversity of life.

With genetics as the language of biology, the vocabulary of biology would be the gene, a unit of heritable information that influences ho we develop and operate. Similarly, the letters of biology would be the individual nucleotides that make up genes. Differences in individual nucleotides, also known as single nucleotide polymorphisms aka SNPs, are responsible for the genetic variation across individuals and can lead to differeing phenotypic outcomes.

Networks of genes and their interactions drive our ability to live. Human disease arises from disruptions to these networks. Medicine, the maintenace of health and the prevention, alleviation, or cure of disease, aims to treat diseases. Unfortunately, medicine today still operates from a "good enough" perspective. The filed of genomics gives us a chance to improve medicine by incorporating genetics.

Indeed, genomics lets us study disease genetics from a "big data" lens.
