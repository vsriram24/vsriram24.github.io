Welcome! I am a biomedical informatics and health machine learning research scientist currently working with Professor [Dokyoon Kim](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9240045)'s [Integrative 'Omics and Biomedical Informatics Lab](https://www.biomedinfolab.com). I also collaborate with [Mandi Hall](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/amhal/) and the [Health Futures Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-health-futures/) at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/).


My general research skills and interests include:
* translational bioinformatics and personalized medicine
* human disease genomics
* network medicine
* deep learning and interpretable machine learning
* big data analytics and cloud-based genomics
* data visualization
* human-centered design

I hold a Ph.D. in Biomedical Informatics and Computational Genomics from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu) [Perelman School of Medicine](https://www.med.upenn.edu). My doctoral work focused on the integration of genomic and phenotypic data from electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobanks, applying network theory and graph-based machine learning methods to evaluate the genetic basis of disease complications and comorbidities. 

Additionally, I hold a Master's degree in Statistics and Data Science from the [Wharton School of Business](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu) as well as Bachelor's degrees in Statistics and Computer Science from [Duke University](https://duke.edu). I am very interested in facilitating and simplifying the process of medical discovery across the landscape of biomedical research. I am also passionate about mentorship and outreach, and I have volunteered for a variety of organizations as a teacher in science education.
