Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Genomics and Computational Biology graduate group](https://www.med.upenn.edu/gcb/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu) [Perelman School of Medicine](https://www.med.upenn.edu), working in Professor [Dokyoon Kim](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9240045)'s [Laboratory for Integrative 'Omics](https://www.biomedinfolab.com). 

My general research skills and interests include:
* translational bioinformatics and personalized medicine
* network medicine
* deep learning and interpretable machine learning
* big data analytics
* data visualization
* human disease genomics

My thesis work focuses on the integration of genomic and phenotypic data from electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobanks, applying network theory and graph-based machine learning methods to evaluate the genetic basis of disease complications and comorbidities. For a full list of my publications, refer [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZN4ZFuUAAAAJ&hl=en), and for a copy of my LinkedIn profile, refer [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivek-sriram/) 

In summer 2022, I worked as a PhD Researcher for [Microsoft Research's Health Futures Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-health-futures/). I previously received a Master's degree in Statistics from the [Wharton School of Business](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu) as well as Bachelor's degrees in Statistics and Computer Science from [Duke University](https://duke.edu). I am passionate about mentorship and outreach, and I have volunteered for a variety of organizations as a teacher in science education.
